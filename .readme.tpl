# xpubsub
A basic pubsub module for communications within an app.

This project is an excercise to help me develop skills relating to:
	+ writing a Python module
	+ publishing modules on pypi
	+ using:
		+ [git](https://pypi.org/project/git)
		+ [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest)
		+ [pyenv](https://pypi.org/project/pyenv)
		+ [poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry)
 		+ [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox)
		+ [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy)

You would probably be better off using [PyPubSub](https://pypi.org/project/PyPubSub/)but this is more fun.


Usage:
```python
{%I example.py
```
Output
```
{%R example.py
```
